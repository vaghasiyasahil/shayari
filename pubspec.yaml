# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/
     - assets/Category/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: F1
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/AGENCYB.TTF
     - family: F2
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/AGENCYR.TTF
     - family: F3
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/arial.TTF
     - family: F4
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/arialbd.TTF
     - family: F5
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/arialbi.TTF
     - family: F6
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/ariali.TTF
     - family: F7
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/ARIALN.TTF
     - family: F8
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/ARIALNB.TTF
     - family: F9
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/Font/ARIALNBI.TTF
#     - family: Trajan Pro
#       fonts:
#         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#           weight: 700
